# doc-extractor-llama-cloud

This project is a document extraction and transformation pipeline powered by LlamaCloud and Pydantic. It reads a mapping schema from Excel, extracts structured data from documents (Excel, PDF) , transforms it based on predefined rules, and exports it to a clean, import-ready Excel file. Perfect for automating manual data entry and converting messy documents into structured formats.
