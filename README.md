# doc-extractor-llama-cloud

This project is a document extraction and transformation pipeline powered by LlamaCloud and Pydantic. It reads a mapping schema from Excel, extracts structured data from documents (Excel, PDF) , transforms it based on predefined rules, and exports it to a clean, import-ready Excel file. Perfect for automating manual data entry and converting messy documents into structured formats.

## How It Works
1. Loads a field mapping schema from an Excel file.
2. Dynamically generates a Pydantic schema based on the mapping.
Uses LlamaCloud to extract structured data from a PDF document.
Maps the extracted JSON data to final column names using a second Excel mapping.
Exports the cleaned and transformed data to a ready-to-use Excel template.
Ideal for automating document processing and reducing manual data cleanup.
